This was the Final Project I submitted for my Geospatial Engineering Course. 

# Rise in Anti-Vax and Mumps Choropleth Analysis

- Measles, mumps, rubella have been making a comeback in the recent years.  The story I am attempting to uncover is whether the number of cases is correlated with the number of people refusing to vaccinate their children, with recent conspiracy hypes.

- My sources of data can be found at these links.  I primarley webscraped data from charts on the CDC website.

- The audience I wish to reach are who might wish to know whether more concern should be raised over recent numbers of mumps cases, or to give a sight for those who may need to convince a spouse to vaccinate their child.

- Conclusion:

Measles mumps rubella vaccine has been a standard vaccination requirement before children entering Kindergarden, triggering an immune response allowing the body to develope anti-bodies and lasting resistance for life.  When comparing the mean number of cumulative mumps out breaks across the nation to the mean percent of population utilizing exemptions by state over time there did not seem to be a clear trend between the two, and perhaps a reverse trend through some time spans.  When comparing the percent of the state population utilizing exemptions to the number of annual cumulative cases of mumps reported there seems to be the same reverse trend for individual states.

These results are not what I expected but could perhaps be explained by some other factor such as travelers bringing mumps from foriegn lands, although the number of people unvaccinated does not help.  The reverse trend in exemptions maybe be do to a lag effect as people are reacting to the news, much like the stock market.  As new cases rise more people may become fearful and vaccinate themselves and their children (especially if a case is witnessed first hand).  As precautions are put in place, the numbers drop and thoughts of conspiracy begin once again.

For my final conclusion, I would have to say that the results are inconclusive and would require a more extensive analysis.  However, I would speculate that the number of people utilizing exemptions might be a response to number of mumps cases, rather than the root cause, although it surely does not help.
